# CS349 W24 Demo Code

Code relating to lecture slides and in-class demos.

Most folders correspond with a set of slides posted on the course website. For example, code for the "Drawing" lecture is in the `drawing/` demo folder. Lecture demo slides will reference specific "sets" of demos, for example the "Drawing" lecture has demo slides with "minimal-canvas" in the title, these correspond to `drawing/src/minimal-canvas`. In some cases a specific function will be noted in the demo slides as well.

You will have to run `npm install` in each lecture demo folder (e.g. in `drawing/`) to run the demos. This installs Vite and any other packages needed for that set of demos.

Demo code will be posted (or updated) shortly before each lecture.

### SimpleKit

This is a simple imperative-style toolkit that runs in the browser. We use it to show examples of UI toolkit architecture and it's used in some assignments.

The `simplekit/` folder contains the modules, but you won't be able to run anything in that folder.

See lecture demos for examples using SimpleKit, and see assignment write-up for details how to use SimpleKit for assignments.

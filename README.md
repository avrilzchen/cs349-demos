# CS349 W24 Demo Code

Code relating to lecture slides and in-class demos.

Most folders correspond with a set of slides posted on the course website. For example, code for the "Drawing" lecture is in the `drawing/` demo folder. Lecture demo slides will reference specific "sets" of demos, for example the "Drawing" lecture has demo slides with "minimal-canvas" in the title, these correspond to `drawing/src/minimal-canvas`. In some cases a specific function will be noted in the demo slides as well.

Demo code will be posted (or updated) shortly before each lecture.

### Setup

After you clone this repo, you'll have to do a bit more setup to run the demos.

1. Run `npm install` in the lecture demo folder you want to run (e.g. in `drawing/`). This installs Vite and other packages needed for that set of demos.

2. For demos requiring SimpleKit, you'll need to do a bit more setup to make the SimpleKit git "submodule" work.

   - Open a terminal and cd to the simplekit folder in the root of this repo (since it's a submodule, it initially appears empty)
   - Initialize the git submodule using `git submodule init`
   - Perform the first update of the git submodule using `git submodule update`
   - Now the simplekit folder will be populated to match the simplekit repo on GitHub, and you'll see the simplekit repo listed in the VS Code source control tab

### Keeping Up to Date

During the term frequently "pull" the latest code from this repo. You can do this from the VS Code "Source Control" interface or on the command line with git commands.

**ðŸ”¥ Always pull from the cs349 public repo first. ðŸ”¥** If the public repo updated the simplekit submodule "link", you'll see a "Change" for the "simplekit" submodule file after pulling ([see image](./_assets/git-pull.png)). **Don't try to commit that change!.** Instead, look at the git info for the simplekit submodule. It'll list 1 or more changes to be synced. Just click on "Sync Changes" for simplekit, and the changed "simplekit" submodule file in the main repo will disappear. Now the simplekit submodule is up-to-date.

(There's a way to make this pulling and updating submodules more automated, but I think it's only possible in git command line and requires changes to your git config.)

> Avoid using VS Code git Autofetch for the SimpleKit submodule. It will "fetch" changes as suggest updating even if the main demo code repo is using a different version of SimpleKit. Only pull SimpleKit when the main repo updates the version.

## SimpleKit

This is a simple imperative-style toolkit that runs in the browser. We use it to show examples of UI toolkit architecture and it's used in the first two assignments.

See lecture demos for examples how to use SimpleKit, and see assignment write-ups for details how to setup SimpleKit for assignments.
